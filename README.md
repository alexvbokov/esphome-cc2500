## Introduction

This [ESPHome External Component](https://esphome.io/components/external_components) lets you
transmit and receive data using a compatible CC2500 transceiver. Other components that depend on
the CC2500 component can build on it.

This component doesn't let you send data nor interpret the received data, you need a separate
component that implements the data format needed for your hardware. In debug and verbose logging
mode it does log all incomming trafic on the default channel with the default settings.

## Hardware required:

- ESP8266, ESP32 or other ESPHome supported microcontroller
- CC2500 transceiver module

## Wiring:

|CC2500| ESP8266 |
|:----:|:-------:|
| GND  |    G    |
| VDD  |   3V    |
|  SI  |D7/GPIO13|
| SCLK |D5/GPIO14|
|  SO  |D6/GPIO12|
| GDO2 |D1/GPIO5 |
| GDO0 |         |
| CSn  |D8/GPIO15|

The solderpads of the CC2500 transceiver is just a bit closer spaced than the width of a ribbon
cable, you need a steady hand to solder the wires.

But I've created a shield that fits the Wemos Mini. Contact me if you like to buy one!

## Configuration variables:
- __cs_pin__ (Required): The pin to use for the chip select of the SPI bus.
- __gdo2_pin__ (Optional): The ESP pin the CC2500 GDO2 pin is connected to. Needed for receiving
  data.
- __output_power__ (Optional): The output power signals should be transmitted with.

### ESPHome example configuration:

To set up this CC2500 component you first need to place a top-level SPI component which defines the
pins to use.
