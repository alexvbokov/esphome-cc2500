# esphome-cc2500
Texas Instruments CC2500 Low-Power 2.4 GHz RF Transceiver component for ESPHome.

This CC2500 component for ESPHome controls the CC200 transeiver for sending data to devices using a compatible receiver. Other components that depend on the CC2500 component can reference it. Receiving data is not yet implemented, but is flanned for a future update.

To set up this CC2500 component you first need to place a top-level SPI component which defines the pins to use.

## Hardware required:
- ESP8266, ESP32 or other ESPHome supported microcontroller
- CC2500 transceiver

## Wiring:

|CC2500| ESP8266 |
|:----:|:-------:|
| GND  |    G    |
| VDD  |   3V    |
|  SI  |D7/GPIO13|
| SCLK |D5/GPIO14|
|  SO  |D6/GPIO12|
| GD02 |         |
| GDO0 |         |
| CSn  |D8/GPIO15|
