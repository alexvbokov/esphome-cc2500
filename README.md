## Introduction

This CC2500 component for ESPHome controls the CC2500 transeiver for sending and receiving data
using a compatible receiver. Other components that depend on the CC2500 component can reference it.

To set up this CC2500 component you first need to place a top-level SPI component which defines the pins to use.

## Hardware required:
- ESP8266, ESP32 or other ESPHome supported microcontroller
- CC2500 transceiver

## Wiring:

|CC2500| ESP8266 |
|:----:|:-------:|
| GND  |    G    |
| VDD  |   3V    |
|  SI  |D7/GPIO13|
| SCLK |D5/GPIO14|
|  SO  |D6/GPIO12|
| GDO2 |D1/GPIO5 |
| GDO0 |         |
| CSn  |D8/GPIO15|

## Configuration variables:
- __cs_pin__ (Required): The pin to use for the chip select of the SPI bus.
- __gdo2_pin__ (Optional): The ESP pin the CC2500 GDO2 pin is connected to.
- __output_power__ (Optional): The output power signals should be transmitted with.
